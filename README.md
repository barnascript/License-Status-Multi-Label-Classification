# License Status Multi Label Classification

## Overview
The Classification algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning technique used to categorize a set of data into classes. For a given example of input data, a classification algorithm assigns the most probable class label. An easy-to-understand example is classifying email as spam or non-spam. There are several use cases of classification in real-world scenarios. This project aims to give the basic idea related to different algorithms used for classification.
